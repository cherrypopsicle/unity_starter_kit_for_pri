# unity_starter_kit_for_pri
Hey Pri! This project is for you to mess around with.

## Prerequisites
- Download Unity Hub
- Download Unity 2022.3.5f1 (or something closer to this version)
- Clone this project
- Open the project from Unity Hub
- Configure Android or iOS Build Settings on Unity
  _OR_
- Press Play button and click around to get points

## Side notes
I didn't include my two scripts from the game. I think it'll confuse you further because we're not there yet. This projects
has `PlayerController.cs` and `CameraController.cs`. Comments are included to explain what's going on in the code. Update the variables in real-time to have some fun!
